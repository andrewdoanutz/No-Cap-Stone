BestFaceForward with LogMeIn

BestFaceForward is a recruiting and interviewing application that provides video and speech sentiment analysis to the candidates and interviewers! Our application is split into two parts: the candidate practice portal and the recruiter/interviewer portal.

The practice portal allows candidates to practice real-life interview questions against a practice bot and see their post-analysis report for the interview along with an overall score! This report is to help the candidate practice how they answer questions and be able to improve before the actual interview!

The recruited and interviewer portal provides an all-inclusive application dashboard where recruiters and interviewers can log in and schedule or view their upcoming interviews, view the info on the candidate they are going to interview, join the interview when the time comes, and view the personalized post-analysis report for the candidate once the interview is complete!

Here is our poster explaining our project! We would like to thank our mentors at LogMeIn for helping us throughout this project and we are excited to have finished 2nd place at the UCSB 2020 Computer Science Summit Capstone competition!
